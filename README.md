## 📌 Project Title
  Student's Score Analysis using Python

## 🧾 Description
  This project focuses on analyzing students' academic performance using Python. It aims to extract meaningful insights from a dataset containing students' scores. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation of student performance patterns using libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## 📊 Objectives
   - Analyze score patterns across different subjects.
   - Visualize score distributions using graphs.
   - Identify trends or performance gaps among students.
   - Demonstrate basic data analysis skills using Python.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
   - Python
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn

## 💡 Future Improvements
  - Add predictive modeling for score prediction.
  - Include demographic analysis (gender, ethnicity, parental education).
  - Deploy an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash.

## 📌 Questions for Analysis
   1. What is the average score in each subject (Math, Reading, Writing)?
   2.Which subject do students generally perform best in?
   3.Are there performance differences based on gender?
   4.Is there a correlation between reading and writing scores?
   5.What percentage of students scored above 80 in all subjects?
